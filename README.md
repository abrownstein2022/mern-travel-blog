## Description
```md
This project was to build a responsive, interactive application using GraphQL with a node.js and express.js server, and JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.  We used MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database, and queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.  The application was deployed to Heroku with seed data.
```

**User Story**
```md
As a person who loves to travel
I want to share my travel experiences and learn from othersâ€™ travel experiences
SO THAT I can plan my future travel destinations
```
**Acceptance Criteria**

```md
GIVEN a MERN-stack single-page application
WHEN I visit the site for the first time
THEN I am presented with the homepage, which includes all existing reviews, as well as homepage links and navigation buttons to log in or sign up
WHEN I choose to sign up
THEN I am prompted to enter my email address, username and password, 
WHEN I complete the sign up process
THEN I am automatically logged into the site
WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to log in
THEN I am prompted to enter my email and password 
WHEN I am signed into the site
THEN I am taken to the homepage that displays existing reviews, with a user profile button, a logout button and a screen to add a new review,
WHEN I enter data into the new review screen and click on the Add Review button
THEN the homepage is refreshed so I see my new review data has been saved
WHEN I click on my profile button in the navigation,
THEN I am presented with a dashboard that displays any reviews I have already created
WHEN I click on the "Edit this Review" link on any of my existing reviews
THEN I am presented with a new screen so I can change my review or I can delete the review entirely
WHEN I click on the delete review button
THEN I am able to delete my review
WHEN I return to my profile page
THEN I see my deleted review no longer exists
WHEN I click on the logout button in the navigation
THEN I am signed out of the site
WHEN I logged in but am idle on the site for more than 5 minutes
THEN I am automatically logged out and must log in again to be able to add new reviews and update/delete my existing reviews
```
